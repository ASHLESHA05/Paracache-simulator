# Cache Simulator

Cache Simulator is a Python application built using PyQt5 for simulating different cache memory mapping techniques. It provides a graphical interface for users to input memory and cache parameters, as well as a sequence of memory addresses to simulate cache hits, misses, and evictions.

## Features

- Supports three cache mapping techniques: Direct Mapped, Set Associative, and Associative.
- Allows users to specify memory size, cache size, block size, and memory address sequence.
- Simulates cache access based on the provided parameters and displays results in real-time.
- Provides visual representation of cache contents and memory access instructions.

## Dependencies

- PyQt5: Python library for creating graphical user interfaces.
- Python 3: Programming language used for development.
- math: Python standard library for mathematical operations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
